# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I was motivated to complete this project through my curiousiy of web development and my excitement to create my first webpage, as well as the encouraging words of my friends and family. 
This study guide was created to help me get through the prework material and organize the information in a clear and structured way. 
This project makes it easy for me to refer back to what I learned in the prework and summarizes the information in my own words, making studying and reviewing the material much easier.
I learned what git and GitHub are as well as the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned what it meands to be a coder and web developer and the mindset they must have to succeed.
